# dev-challenge
A dev challenge for anyone who wants to join the Lane engineering team! 

### Database
Our CTO is an absolute genius and has invented a new kind of JSON database.
To KISS, it's all implemented as separate JSON files for each record.  The 
file format is ${id}.json.

We don't want to change that database. We've built our whole company around it!

There are many todo's in the project.  Each todo has a point score based on how
difficult it is.  Search for todos and do as many as you can.

Choose at least one 1 pointer, one 3 pointer and one 5 pointer.  Implement your 
answers, and send back to use to check out.
